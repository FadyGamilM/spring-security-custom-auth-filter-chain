# spring-security-custom-auth-filter-chain
This project illustrate the 2nd part of spring-security customization where I will implement the Custom-auth-filter, the Custom-auth-manager, and the Custom-auth-provider.

The parts I will customize in this project:
- the custom authentication filter. 
- the custom authentication manager. 
- the custom authentication provider.
- the whole system will rely on a secret key should be included in the request header instead of relying on username & Password combination.
